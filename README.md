## Stretch Goals
* Catch all error handling - currently if the user selects a city that does not have a dog or cat in a specific age range - the location error pop up shows up. Solution is to implement more error handling rather than the current catch all error message.
* If the user decides not to share location and input their address it requires 'city' comma 'province/state' - implement a drop down box or auto-complete to prevent poor user experience.
