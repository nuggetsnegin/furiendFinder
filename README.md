# Furiend Finder
A JavaScript and API *purr* programming project that utilizes 4 APIs to help users find their *purrfect* forever friend! Allows the user to filter by location (permission pop-up or user input), pet type (cat/dog), and age range.

## Stretch Goals
* Catch all error handling - currently if the user selects a city that does not have a dog or cat in a specific age range - the location error pop up shows up. Solution is to implement more error handling rather than the current catch all error message.
* If the user decides not to share location and input their address it requires 'city' comma 'province/state' - implement a drop down box or auto-complete to prevent poor user experience.
* Currently displays a maximum of 100 randomized adoptable pets  - a better solution would be to add pagination rather than randomization.
* Implement a database so that the user can save a list of potential adoptable pets rather than having to re-visit the page and go through the search again.
